As I open the door, I can't see anything as all the lights are out, yet I sense something there, something ominous...  
A presence I haven't felt for over 1000 years. It reminds me of when I was in warlock training. An old nemesis perhaps? Maybe it
is a long forgotten lover?  Whatever it is, it isn't happy and it also senses me as well.

Then, it came to me! I know this presence. Lady Samantha.... And yes, she was a long forgotten lover, well, apparantly not so long
forgotten.  Not only was she a lover of Lovers, but she was also one of the most talented sorceresses I had ever encountered.  
Should I flee the room back where I came from? Or should I face her head on?  She also knows I am here and feels my presence.  Her 
hatred for me is very evident in the immense rage I feel emminating throughout the room.  If I flee, I am guaranteed that she will find me.
Her renound in the magical arts and ability to track a foe proceed her, yet I am not the warlock I once was.

What should I do?
1. Deal with my fears and face my opponent head on in a Battle of the Dark arts?
2. Attempt to speak to this presence (Lady Samantha) and come to a truce or understanding?
3. Or... Escape back through the door to face her another day?


Face head on......

Attempt to speak to Lady Samantha....

Escape back through the door.....
