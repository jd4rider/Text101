  storyText: "As I open the door, I can't see anything as all the lights are out,
    yet I sense something there, something ominous...  \rA presence I haven't felt
    for over 1000 years. It reminds me of when I was in warlock training. An old nemesis
    perhaps? Maybe it\r is a long forgotten lover?  Whatever it is, it isn't happy
    and it also senses me as well.\r\n\r\nThen, it dawned on me! I know this presence.
    Lady Samantha.... And yes, she was a long forgotten lover, well, apparantly not
    so long\r forgotten.  Not only was she a lover of Lovers, but she was also one
    of the most talented sorceresses I had ever encountered.  \rShould I flee the
    room back where I came from? Or should I face her head on?  She also knows I am
    here and feels my presence.  Her \r\nhatred for me is very evident in the immense
    rage I feel emminating from her presence.  If I flee, I am guaranteed that she
    will find me.\r Her renound in the magical arts and ability to track a foe proceed
    her, yet I am not the warlock I once was.\r\n\r\nWhat should I do?\r\n1. Deal
    with my fears and face my opponent head on?\r\n2. Escape back through the door
    to face her another day?"
